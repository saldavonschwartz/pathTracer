Path Tracer
===========

This is a work-in-progress implementation of a path tracer, largely based on Peter Shirley's *Ray Tracing in One Weekend* series of tutorials plus other resources.

It currently runs on MacOS and is CPU only. However the plan is to add CUDA support (perhaps Vulkan and/or Metal too) as well as to continue extending its features.

A detailed writeup of the project will eventually live `here <https://0xfede.io/2020/04/16/pathTracer.html>`_.
